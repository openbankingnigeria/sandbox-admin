# Production Ready

Completing the certification course means an institution's APIs are production ready. A letter of completion is issued to the AP admin personnel through their designated email and all production credentials are deleted from their OBN profile within 15 business days of completing the certification; however, the certification results are preserved. OBN will subsequently publish the AP's logo and date of completion on the portal.

Internally, there may be additional work to be done to establish new processes with the relevant stakeholders within the institution.
