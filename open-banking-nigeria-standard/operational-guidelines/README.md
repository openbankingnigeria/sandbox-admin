# Operational Guidelines

The operational guidelines prescribe the levels of service required of APs and TPPs in the Open Banking system. These guidelines are essential to a consistent user experience across the Open Banking network. The operational imperatives are:

1. To promote high service levels across the network
2. To create a positive experience with customers, building trust by maintaining consistency in Open Banking processes across all platforms, offerings and providers.
3. To ensure that APs and TPPs support open APIs with standard operational procedures that minimizes the need for exceptional intervention into every-day processes.
